when is useEffect called? ------- important for interview

useEffect(()=>{},[]) // syntax

It is called after every render of component. Everytime out component renders, useEffect is called, with no dependency array.
But with dependency array, useEffect(()=>{},)

if empty - useEffect(()=>{},[]) --- usEffect is called ust once, initially. It wont be called again and again , even if component re renders.
if having some dependency --- useEffect(()=>{},[...]) --- it is called everytime dependency changes. 

Never call useState() outside of the component, it is used for creating localside variables inside the component, always call in the 
top of component , because react is a single thread language, it reads from top to bottom.... 
Never use inside if-else/ for-loop/ function, this can create in-consistensies in the program.
