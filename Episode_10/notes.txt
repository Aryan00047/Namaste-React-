sass and scss ---- 
<This is not a recommended way to write css in react>

styled components is another way to write css. Industries use this a lot.
material ui or chakra ui are component libraries which use styled components internally.
They give pre styled components which we can use directly.
Bootstrap also uses styled components internally.
ant design is another component library which uses styled components internally.S

You can use any of these libraries.

Tail wind css: uses POSt CSS behind the scenes.
Post CSS is a tool to transform css with js.
import tailwind into css file

tailwind css is very loght weight, and parcel will only include/import the css required on the web page. The classes are icluded 
once , even if used multiple times.

disadvantage: class names are big and it makes out code looks ugly.

to add custom styles , w-[200px] this way we can add custome styles

you can configure css according to conditions, refer header part.
