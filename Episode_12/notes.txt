Redux:

Redux is not mandatory.... Most people start using from day one but they don't know if it is even requierd?
React and Redux are different libraries.
Zustand is also a state management library --- used in many companies. Like this there are many state management libraries.

Advantages of using Redux:
Applicatoins become easier to debug. (using Redux Dev Tools)

Redux is used mostly used with React but it is also used with other frameworks and libraries.
There are two librries of redus: React Redux and Redux Toolkit
React-Redux is a bridge between React and Redux. 

Today, we are going to learn Redux Toolkit: It is a modern way to write code and most tutorials are on  old way of writig redux.
Redux comes with a huge learning curve and vanilla redux was more complicated than redux-tookit.

Slices in redux store means seperate logical parts for diffreent usecases.

We can't directly modify the slices. First we have to dispatch action. Then it calls a Reducer function and that function modifies the slice of the store.

For Writing Data:
ADD Button in menu ---> dispatches action ---> calls a function(Reducer) ---> internally modifies cart slice.

For Reading Data:
We use Selector for this.

Cart Slice ---> Selector ---> Cart Symbol in header reads the data

This phenomenon of using selector is known as subscribing to the store.(data is in sync with the store)
