Single Responsiblity Principle: 
Each component shuld have a single responsiblity:
Keeping code modular and small intp components helps it become Reusabel, Testable , Maintainable

Your code should be readable, so that others can also read it easily

Custom Hooks:
Our code will be more optimized because of custom hook.

We write custom hooks in utils, and its better to have seperate file for each hook.

Creating custom hook is not mandatory, but it is good way to write code.
