Best practice is to make seperate files for spearate components
Every project always has src folder (source code) -- industry follows this
Its clean and everybody understands this

Try to match the component name with its file and in Capital letter. It will help other dev to immediately understand what will be there

Some people like to write jsx also... instead of js
What is a good way? --- it hardly matters both are similar thing. It will make zero diff.

Keep things simple always, don't complicate things

import Header  from "./components/Header"; -- even if we don't use .js or .jsx, react will automatically assume this as js object.

Never ever keep hard coded data in the component, we add them in utils folder (config or common is also used as a name), will start from small letter

A module can only have one default export. 
So, one way to export is using default export (for single thing)
export default Header.... (default export) and is imported like import Header from "path";

or if we have to export multiple things then we have to use named export
export const CDN_URL.... (named export) and is imported like import { CDN_URL } from "../utils/constants";

It's always a good practice to keep your components small, create a new file for new component always
