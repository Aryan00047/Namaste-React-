Best practice is to make seperate files for spearate components
Every project always has src folder (source code) -- industry follows this
Its clean and everybody understands this

Try to match the component name with its file and in Capital letter. It will help other dev to immediately understand what will be there

Some people like to write jsx also... instead of js
What is a good way? --- it hardly matters both are similar thing. It will make zero diff.

Keep things simple always, don't complicate things
