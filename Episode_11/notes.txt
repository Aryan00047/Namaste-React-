Higher ORder Component- takes component as input and returns (modified,enhanced/tweaked) component as output.

These are pure functions(it will not change anything of the component passed to it)
We only enhance the component passed to it.

important part of react application is to manage its data. UI is static , does not have logic of its own.
UI is different part and data is different part. All applications have two layers:
Data Layer - consists of state, props, local variables ....
UI Layer - powered by data layer.

If you how to manage the data part in application, your application will be super fast.

In this episdoe, we will learn about data layer.

//we will work on accordion.
Accordion is closing and opening of items on click.

in js, we don't use @types --- we can use types directly but to use @types we need to add it in ['@types'] in json structure 
while fetching api.

controlled and uncontrolled components:
if restaurant was controlling itself for showItems then it was uncontrolled component. but if we give that power to parent 
component then it is controlled component.

we cannot directly change the stae of parent component through child component but can change indirectly by passing 
setState function as prop to child component.

Lifting state up - advanced concept- sometimes we have to lift the state of child component to parent component to manage the state
