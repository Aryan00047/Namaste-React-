every dependency will have its own package.json

whatever you can regenerate, you should not put it on git. (node_modules)

npm is for installin the packages, npx is for executing them

parcel goes to the root file and builds a development builder for our app and it hosts it to the localhost.
-dev build, local server, HMR = Hot Module Replacement, File Watching Algorithim(written in c++) - keeps track of changes and updates them
- caching - faster builds (reduces builds time after caching), image optimization, minification, bundling, compress files, consistent hashing, code spliting,
differential bundling (support older browsers), diagnostic, error handling, https, tree shking - remove unused code ,
different dev and productioin bundles
Parcel uses other libraries for operations. It is managing everything for us.

React makes app fast but bundlers like parcel also plays a major role in making it fast for large scale apps.

cdn is not a preferred way to bring react and react dom to your package, because, we have to send network call all the time
for fetching react. But, we can store the react in our node modules directly.(npm i react and npm i react-dom)

need to remove main field from package.json when we are giving entry point to parcel in command itself during prod.
